# LDPlayer-Shortcut-Creator
This is an automatic Shortcut Creator of any apps installed on LDPlayer. I noticed some posts about making .bat files for every app and thought why not just automatize it and make it as simple as possible.

Huuge props to reddit users for creating guides on these .bat shortcuts such as: https://old.reddit.com/r/LDPlayerEmulator/comments/t31m0k/guide_creating_windows_shortcuts_to_directly/

How to create and run your new shortcut:
NOTE: Shortcuts are created next to the Shortcut Creator and they're in .bat format. You can Right-Click them and click on Edit to see the code, but it's super simple sutff.
NOTE 2: I only tested this with LDPlayer9.

1. Download the program from release tab.
2. You need to insert 4 things:
2.a) Installation path of your LDPlayer in quotes. For example: "C:\LDPlayer\LDPlayer9\"

2.b) The name of your LDPlayer instance. Default name for LDPlayer instance is LDPlayer so insert that into the text box or if you named it something different insert that instead.
  
2.c) Package name of the app you want to create shortcut of. Go to the Google Play Store and find your app, then check your link. It should look like this:
  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tozelabs.tvshowtime
     What we want is this com.tozelabs.tvshowtime in my example. Copy and paste it into the Shortcut Creator.
     
2.d) And finally, name your Shortcut. After that click on Create button and your new Shortcut should appear next to the Shortcut Creator executable.
  
I would highly recommend running this bat as administrator because from my testing it works the best.
