# Future
This project has been a fun ride. The main purpose of starting this project was to switch from using Windows Forms to WPF (We used Windows Forms in the University and now swapped to a completely different language) just because I wanted to see how they worked and how big of a difference there is between Windows Forms and WPF. Also, another reason why I made this project is that I actually use LDPlayer because it is much much faster than Windows Subsystem for Android and having Windows Subsystem for Android enabled means that applications like ThrottleStop don't work properly and for me that is a huge hit when I'm using my Laptop.

The program now should work how it was supposed to work. Tested it on 2 different computers (Desktop and a Laptop) and for me it works perfectly fine. V3 will probably be UI update (When I learn to use something other than default WPF controls) and after that, the only thing left to do is bugfixes because the program has pretty much every feature I wanted it to have, If someone has a feature they would like to have, open up an issue and I'll see what I can do.

QUICK NOTE TO LDPLAYER DEVS: Keep up the work on your emulator. It's probably the fastest emulator for Android right now. The only thing that is missing is this Shortcut Creator that for example Nox Player has, but other than that, really great emulator.

# LDPlayer-Shortcut-Creator
This is an automatic Shortcut Creator of any apps installed on LDPlayer. I noticed some posts about making .bat files for every app and thought why not just automatize it and make it as simple as possible.

Huuge props to reddit users for creating guides on these .bat shortcuts such as: https://old.reddit.com/r/LDPlayerEmulator/comments/t31m0k/guide_creating_windows_shortcuts_to_directly/

How to create and run your new shortcut:

NOTE: I only tested this with LDPlayer9.

1. Download the program from release tab.
2. You need to insert your Instance name and check for Installation Path if it's correct. 
3. You can change the Shortcut Name to whatever you want. The app only grabbs the name that LDPlayer gives.
4. Click create and you should see a shortcut on your Desktop.
