# LDPlayer-Shortcut-Creator
This is an automatic Shortcut Creator of any apps installed on LDPlayer. I noticed some posts about making .bat files for every app and thought why not just automatize it and make it as simple as possible.

Huuge props to reddit users for creating guides on these .bat shortcuts such as: https://old.reddit.com/r/LDPlayerEmulator/comments/t31m0k/guide_creating_windows_shortcuts_to_directly/

How to create and run your new shortcut:
NOTE: I only tested this with LDPlayer9.

1. Download the program from release tab.
2. You need to insert your Instance name and check for Installation Path if it's correct. 
3. You can change the Shortcut Name to whatever you want. The app only grabbs the name that LDPlayer gives.
4. Click create and you should see a shortcut on your Desktop.
